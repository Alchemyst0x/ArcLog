# **ArcLog**

_Structured Python logging <sup>(for the Arcane üßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)</sup>._

This project is essentially just my personal logging configuration, which I aim
to make into a small library of sorts.

## Features (Planned)

- [ ] JSON logs for structured logging output.
- [ ] Integration with [structlog] for flexible and powerful logging.
- [ ] Support for [msgspec], including `msgspec.Struct` `LogRecord` objects for
      efficient serialization.
- [ ] Borrowed code and ideas from other great projects, like
      [python-json-logger] and [litestar].
- [ ] ???

## Getting Started

This project is still in the early stages of development. Stay tuned for
installation instructions and usage examples.
