# **ArcLog**

_Structured Python logging <sup>(for the Arcane üßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)</sup>._

This project is essentially just my personal logging configuration, which I aim
to make into a small library of sorts.

## Features (Planned)

- [ ] JSON logs for structured logging output.
- [x] Implementation of [`functools.singledispatch`] for performant and
      efficient encoding of a wide variety of Python data types.
- [ ] Integration with [`structlog`] for flexible and powerful logging.
- [ ] Support for [`msgspec`], including `msgspec.Struct` `LogRecord` objects
      for efficient serialization.
- [ ] Borrowed code and ideas from other great projects, like
      [`python-json-logger`] and [`litestar`].
- [ ] ???
